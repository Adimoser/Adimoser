## Welcome to my Github Profile :wave:

My Name is Adrian and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the [School of Engineering ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/).

Beside studying Informatics, I also work for a company named [SBB](https://company.sbb.ch/de/jobs-karriere/arbeiten-bei-der-sbb.html). It's the national train company in Switzerland.

Most of the time I work in Web Development, but I also have many other interests I want to look for.
